TestFlow Python Package

TestFlow is a Python package for executing and validating ATOMS hardware-testing scripts.
It enables engineers to run .atoms test workflows, control instruments, and generate measurement outputs through a simple, programmable interface.

This package is provided under the TestFlow Community License (TCL) — free for internal testing, evaluation, and research, but not permitted for commercial use or integration into competing tools without written permission.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/testflowinfovalidationreport-afk/testflow.git
cd testflow


Install locally:

pip install .

 Usage Example
import testflow

script_path = r"C:/path/to/script.atoms"
output_path = r"C:/path/to/output_folder/"

testflow.run_script(script_path, output_path)


This will parse the ATOMS script, execute supported commands, interact with connected instruments, and generate output files in the specified directory.
